# new-express-basic
Created an extremely basic express app as a newbie. 

How to use:
1) Register with name, email, and a 6 letter password 
2) Register page should take user back to login page, login with the correct email and password 
3) You will be welcomed to the dashboard 
4) You are able to logout 

This was a very basic app that I built with express, mongoDB, and node.js
